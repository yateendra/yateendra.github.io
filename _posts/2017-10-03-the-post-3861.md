*While the social network enabled the ability to write longer tweets only to a small group of users, they already found a way to manually activate it.*

Step by step to activate 280 characters on Twitter

Twitter announced that it would extend the amount of characters that can be used in the tweets will be duplicated. Instead of the current 140, messages of 280 may be published.

While many users already have the ability to type at 280 characters, most of the millions who use the social network on a daily basis do not yet have this feature enabled. The good thing is that developers found a way to do it by hand.

2. Use Tampermonkey to run the following GitHub script
